This is a sample Android application üì± built to demonstrate use of *Web Scraping in Android apps*. Dedicated to all Android Developers with ‚ù§Ô∏è. 

***You can Install and test latest app from below üëá***

[![TrueWebScraper App](https://img.shields.io/badge/TrueWebScraperüç≤-APK-red.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=android)](https://github.com/happysingh23828/TrueWebScraper/raw/master/files/TrueWebScraper.apk)


## - About
This app simply get the contents of [this webpage](https://truecaller.blog/2018/01/22/life-as-an-android-engineer/). There are three functionality which are being implemented in this app.
 * Get first nth character. 
 * Get every nth character of the content.
 * Get uniques words with their occurence counts.
 * Switch button is given to differentiate between scraping the raw html/javascript or plain readable text [it uses jsoup to convert html to doc].

## - Built With üõ†
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Rx-Java](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) - For composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes. 
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) - HTTP client that's efficient by default: HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
- [Jsoup](https://jsoup.org/) - Provides a very convenient API for fetching URLs and extracting and manipulating data, using the best of HTML5 DOM methods and CSS selectors.

## - Modules of App
  ### App 
  It uses the all the components and class releated to Android Framework. It has activity, viewmodel and base classes.
  
  ### BuildSrc
  This module helps to list and manage all the dependencies of the app at one place. It has list of dependencies and versions of that dependencies.
  
  ### Remote
  The Remote layer handles all communications with remote sources, in our case it makes a simple API call using a Retrofit interface. 
  
  ### ContentScraper
  This module is resusable for kotlin multiplatform support as it is having pure kotlin code. It has two public API interfaces.
* [ContentScraper](https://github.com/happysingh23828/TrueWebScraper/blob/master/ContentScraper/src/main/java/com/androchef/contentscraper/ContentScraper.kt) - It will take one string as input and perform some scraping actions on it. 
* [RemoteContentScraper](https://github.com/happysingh23828/TrueWebScraper/blob/master/ContentScraper/src/main/java/com/androchef/contentscraper/RemoteContentScraper.kt) - It will take one web url and will be preforming actions on web page content.

## Why I have used multimodule approch?.
* Clear isolation between code. so it will be easy to reuse.
* We can make subprojects out of this approch. [ **eg:** : you can reuse ContentScraper for any android app or for kotlin multiplatform]
* No fragile and rigidity code , so it will be easy to maintain and scale.
 
## - Current App's Architecture
This app uses [***MVVM (Model View View-Model)***](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide#recommended-app-arch) architecture.

## - Future Plans
1. Add more unit test cases. 
2. Use dependency injection etc.

## If this project helps you in anyway, show your love :heart: by putting a :star: on this project :v:
